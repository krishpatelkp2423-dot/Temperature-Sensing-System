This is the code for my First Initial MCU-Based Project. 
This project get the temperature of the room displays it on a LCD display and then graphs it in python

The parts needed for this project are
thermister
LCD Display
male to female wires
buzzer
resisters
male to male wires
Arduino micro controller

The ardino code is set up for 3 modes 
1. Temperature display that it gets the tempeture and displays it on the LCD display and if above the set temp the buzzer will go off
2. the buzzer constantly goes off
3. data collection mode: where the serial monitor is used to collect data so that the python script can graph it
